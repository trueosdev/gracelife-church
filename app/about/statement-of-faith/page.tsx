const introduction = "The New Hampshire Confession of Faith stands as a significant and unifying document in the history of American Baptist theology. Crafted primarily by J. Newton Brown, it was designed to articulate a clear and accessible summary of core Baptist beliefs during a time of evangelical expansion and missionary zeal. The confession is notable for its warmly Reformed tone, holding to essential Reformed doctrines such as divine grace, human depravity, and the perseverance of the saints, while avoiding the more rigid formulations of earlier confessions. Its moderate and irenic spirit made it well-suited for a broad audience, fostering unity among Baptists engaged in gospel ministry and theological education. Over time, it gained widespread acceptance, influencing the doctrinal foundations of institutions, continuing to shape Baptist identity well into the modern era."
